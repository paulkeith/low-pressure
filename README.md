# Low Pressure

This is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that has is quick, responsive and doesn't use javascript.  It's partly inspired by [Idle Words](https://idlewords.com/).  It powers [longfetch.com](https://www.longfetch.com).

A single post is shown with links to the next and previous posts, where available.  The homepage shows the latest post.  On desktop every page is shown with links to the homepage and the RSS feed, a list of the five most recent posts and a tag cloud.

There's no tracking and no analytics.

## Installation
Add this theme as a Git submodule inside your Hugo site folder:
```
git submodule add https://github.com/prophecymattress/nerdgasm.git themes/nerdgasm
```

Then point your config file at the themes/nerdgasm directory.
